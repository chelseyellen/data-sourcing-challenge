# data-sourcing-challenge
## Introduction
This class challenge was to work with APIs via the New York Times and The Movie Database, and then manipulate the data to produce meaningful outputs that can be utilized in various ways. This challenge worked through:
* Creating and utilizing a .env file and ensuring it did not load to GitHub
* Accessing APIs
* Building query URLs based upon the specific API needs
* Work with JSON files
* Converting the JSON to DataFrames
* Merging & cleaning the data
* Exporting the data into a CSV

## Results
This challenge was straight forward yet infinitely complex. I learned a lot from the exercise about understanding how to properly build query URLs which is where I ran into the most difficulties throughout. It was also interesting to adjust the parameters of the API calls to ensure I did not time out the responses, as I am used to making minor tweaks and "seeing what happens" in previous exercises, but this one had a limit on how much I could do within reason daily. I found this to be a beneficial exercise that taught me a lot.

* Office hours help from Yuyang Zhong
* Support from classmates outside of class; Lonnie Aldredge helped me troubleshoot my TMDB URL and Shawn Feils helped me build the "Counter" for the TMDB API call
